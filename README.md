# social_navigation
Human-Robot Interaction ROS Project #2

I implemented a human robot following algorithm in turtlesim. I adjust the angular and linear velocity of the robot turtle to encroach towards the human turtle. Given more time, I would have liked to implement the opening space policy discussed in the "Destination Unknown" paper as well, so that the robot would have an idea of social space.
